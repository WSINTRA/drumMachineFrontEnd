Once it is working you can click on the title and the available kits should appear or you can create a new one using sound sample URL's.


Front end for Drum Machine project
Drum machine that uses webGL, built for mod 3 prject at Flatiron school.

Drum machine connects to an API, built in rails and collects drum sounds and connects them into a drum kit.
In the background there is a space scene with 8 spheres to represent each drum pad, this uses the THREE.JS framework.



MVP was to make the drumkit work.
